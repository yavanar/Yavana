# 1. Introduction
India, the seventh largest country by area and the second most populous country in the world, holds the current population to 141.2 crores. While India’s population growth is stabilising, it is still growing at 0.7% per year. The increase in population has led to rapid progress in urbanization, industrialization and demands for all consumer goods. As a by product of such developments, India generates 62 million tonnes of waste each year. This paper focusses on “organic solid waste management in India.” The problem in achieving the processing and recycling of organic solid waste (wet waste) is highlighted and the possible solution is discussed.
# 2. Solid Waste
## 2.1 Classification of Solid Waste
The process of collecting, treating and disposing of solid waste is termed as solid waste management. The solid waste constitutes of the solid materials that are discarded because it has served its purpose or is no longer useful. Every country follows its tailored solid waste management procedures to maintain clean and healthy environment. Improper disposal of municipal solid waste can create unsanitary conditions and in turn can lead to pollution of environment and outbreaks of vector – borne diseases.
According to “Solid waste management rules 2016” issued by Government of India, “Solid waste” means and includes the following types of solid materials that are discarded as waste.

All non-hazardous solid waste from a community that requires collection and transport to a processing or disposal site is called Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). The Municipal Solid Waste is further classified into Dry organic waste and Wet Organic waste. The classification of solid waste is given in the figure below.

# 3. Problems in Organic Solid Waste Management
Wet waste is basically all types of biodegradable organic waste. This includes all the kitchen waste that we produce such as vegetable peels, used tea bags, fruits, leftovers, coconut shells, flowers, leaves, meat, expired food items, bread, biscuits etc. This wet waste is the organic solid waste that can be recycled or composted.
## 3.1 Case Study: Wet waste management in Chennai
As a case study, Chennai, a metropolitan city in India generates around 5400 metric tonne of waste per day from 15 zones of Greater Chennai Corporation. Out of this, wet waste constitutes to 50% of garbage. Hence, effective management of wet waste becomes very essential.

### Landfills
Any waste that is not recycled or reused has to go somewhere, and it usually ends up at a landfill site. Landfill sites can be created from a void made by quarrying or may form part of land reclamation scheme. At present, garbage generated in Chennai is being dumped at two land fill sites in the city. So, the landfill sites contain both household and commercial wastes. The household waste that gets to the landfill sites mainly comprises of food waste and kitchen waste. These types of bio- degradable waste are termed as organic solid waste or wet waste.

### Problems with Landfills
The problems faced by the human community and environment due to landfill sites is shown in the below figure.

### Pollution
Landfills are a major source of pollution. Dumping and burning of garbage at the landfill causes air pollution especially in summer. A WHO report titled ‘Waste and human health: Evidence and needs’ says improper waste management and illegal waste shipments can result in soil, water and air pollution. Living in the vicinity of a dumpyard can be a health risk for residents because they may be exposed to pollutants through different pathways: the inhalation of substances emitted by the site, contact with water or polluted soil, directly or through the consumption of products, or through contaminated water, the study says. The landfill worsens air pollution with the increasing levels of both particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.

### Leachate
Leachate is the liquid formed when waste breaks down in the landfill and water filters through that waste. This liquid is highly toxic and can pollute land, ground water and water ways. Landfill contains vast quantities of substances that are harmful to the environment. Plastics such as PVC and other materials leach toxic chemicals as they break down. E-waste is the fastest growing waste segment in the developed world. Even though it’s the most toxic everyday waste stream of all, most of it ends up in landfill. Electronic waste is loaded with heavy metals, solvents, and acids. Rainwater filtering through the landfill dissolves and flushes 5-7 percent of the toxins with it to create a foul-smelling liquor, known as leachate, which contains ammonia and various toxic salts.

### Toxins
Many materials that end up as waste contain toxic substances. Electronic waste is an example. Waste such as televisions, computers and other electronic appliances contain a long list of hazardous substances, including mercury, arsenic, cadmium, PVC, solvents, acids and lead. Over time, these toxins leach into our soil and groundwater, and become environmental hazards for years. This combined with emissions of other toxic gases from fires, increases the toxic exposure of local communities significantly.

### Greenhouse gases
Greenhouse gas production is perhaps the biggest environmental threat posed by landfills. When organic material such as food scraps and green waste is put in landfill, it is generally compacted down and covered. This removes the oxygen and causes it to break down in an anaerobic process. Eventually this releases methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Landfill gas comprises 35-55% methane and 30-44% carbon dioxide. Methane is also a flammable gas that can become dangerous if allowed to build up in concentration.  The implications for global warming and climate change are enormous. The bio-degradable waste can be recycled or composted to eliminate many of these problems.

### Legacy waste
Legacy wastes are the wastes that have been collected and kept for years at the landfill sites. This type of waste includes contained or stored wastes, buried waste, contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated building material and structures etc. The Legacy waste not only occupy large space, but also become a breeding ground for pathogens, flies, stench and generation of leachate. They also contribute to the generation of greenhouse gases and pose risk of uncontrollable fire. The Central Pollution Control Board has proposed the Biomining method for the effective disposal of legacy waste. 

### Physical composition of waste
The physical composition of waste generated in Chennai is given in the table below.
