# Introduction
India, the seventh largest country by area and the second most populous country in the world, holds the current population to 141.2 crores. While India’s population growth is stabilising, it is still growing at 0.7% per year. The increase in population has led to rapid progress in urbanization, industrialization and demands for all consumer goods. As a by product of such developments, India generates 62 million tonnes of waste each year. This paper focusses on “organic solid waste management in India.” The problem in achieving the processing and recycling of organic solid waste (wet waste) is highlighted and the possible solution is discussed.
