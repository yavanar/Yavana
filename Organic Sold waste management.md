# 1. Introduction
India, the seventh largest country by area and the second most populous country in the world, holds the current population to 141.2 crores. While India’s population growth is stabilising, it is still growing at 0.7% per year. The increase in population has led to rapid progress in urbanization, industrialization and demands for all consumer goods. As a by product of such developments, India generates 62 million tonnes of waste each year. This paper focusses on “organic solid waste management in India.” The problem in achieving the processing and recycling of organic solid waste (wet waste) is highlighted and the possible solution is discussed.
# 2. Solid Waste
## 2.1 Classification of Solid Waste
The process of collecting, treating and disposing of solid waste is termed as solid waste management. The solid waste constitutes of the solid materials that are discarded because it has served its purpose or is no longer useful. Every country follows its tailored solid waste management procedures to maintain clean and healthy environment. Improper disposal of municipal solid waste can create unsanitary conditions and in turn can lead to pollution of environment and outbreaks of vector – borne diseases.
According to “Solid waste management rules 2016” issued by Government of India, “Solid waste” means and includes the following types of solid materials that are discarded as waste.

All non-hazardous solid waste from a community that requires collection and transport to a processing or disposal site is called Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). The Municipal Solid Waste is further classified into Dry organic waste and Wet Organic waste. The classification of solid waste is given in the figure below.

# 3. Problems in Organic Solid Waste Management
Wet waste is basically all types of biodegradable organic waste. This includes all the kitchen waste that we produce such as vegetable peels, used tea bags, fruits, leftovers, coconut shells, flowers, leaves, meat, expired food items, bread, biscuits etc. This wet waste is the organic solid waste that can be recycled or composted.
## 3.1 Case Study: Wet waste management in Chennai
As a case study, Chennai, a metropolitan city in India generates around 5400 metric tonne of waste per day from 15 zones of Greater Chennai Corporation. Out of this, wet waste constitutes to 50% of garbage. Hence, effective management of wet waste becomes very essential.

### Landfills
Any waste that is not recycled or reused has to go somewhere, and it usually ends up at a landfill site. Landfill sites can be created from a void made by quarrying or may form part of land reclamation scheme. At present, garbage generated in Chennai is being dumped at two land fill sites in the city. So, the landfill sites contain both household and commercial wastes. The household waste that gets to the landfill sites mainly comprises of food waste and kitchen waste. These types of bio- degradable waste are termed as organic solid waste or wet waste.

### Problems with Landfills
The problems faced by the human community and environment due to landfill sites is shown in the below figure.
![Problems with Landfills](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119152666/205009400-a441a9d7-8200-4144-8c7a-e68378f4dc3c.png)

### Pollution
Landfills are a major source of pollution. Dumping and burning of garbage at the landfill causes air pollution especially in summer. A WHO report titled ‘Waste and human health: Evidence and needs’ says improper waste management and illegal waste shipments can result in soil, water and air pollution. Living in the vicinity of a dumpyard can be a health risk for residents because they may be exposed to pollutants through different pathways: the inhalation of substances emitted by the site, contact with water or polluted soil, directly or through the consumption of products, or through contaminated water, the study says. The landfill worsens air pollution with the increasing levels of both particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.

### Leachate
Leachate is the liquid formed when waste breaks down in the landfill and water filters through that waste. This liquid is highly toxic and can pollute land, ground water and water ways. Landfill contains vast quantities of substances that are harmful to the environment. Plastics such as PVC and other materials leach toxic chemicals as they break down. E-waste is the fastest growing waste segment in the developed world. Even though it’s the most toxic everyday waste stream of all, most of it ends up in landfill. Electronic waste is loaded with heavy metals, solvents, and acids. Rainwater filtering through the landfill dissolves and flushes 5-7 percent of the toxins with it to create a foul-smelling liquor, known as leachate, which contains ammonia and various toxic salts.

### Toxins
Many materials that end up as waste contain toxic substances. Electronic waste is an example. Waste such as televisions, computers and other electronic appliances contain a long list of hazardous substances, including mercury, arsenic, cadmium, PVC, solvents, acids and lead. Over time, these toxins leach into our soil and groundwater, and become environmental hazards for years. This combined with emissions of other toxic gases from fires, increases the toxic exposure of local communities significantly.

### Greenhouse gases
Greenhouse gas production is perhaps the biggest environmental threat posed by landfills. When organic material such as food scraps and green waste is put in landfill, it is generally compacted down and covered. This removes the oxygen and causes it to break down in an anaerobic process. Eventually this releases methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Landfill gas comprises 35-55% methane and 30-44% carbon dioxide. Methane is also a flammable gas that can become dangerous if allowed to build up in concentration.  The implications for global warming and climate change are enormous. The bio-degradable waste can be recycled or composted to eliminate many of these problems.

### Legacy waste
Legacy wastes are the wastes that have been collected and kept for years at the landfill sites. This type of waste includes contained or stored wastes, buried waste, contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated building material and structures etc. The Legacy waste not only occupy large space, but also become a breeding ground for pathogens, flies, stench and generation of leachate. They also contribute to the generation of greenhouse gases and pose risk of uncontrollable fire. The Central Pollution Control Board has proposed the Biomining method for the effective disposal of legacy waste. 

### Physical composition of waste
The physical composition of waste generated in Chennai is given in the table below.

| Physical Composition | Percentage % |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Food waste | 8.00% |
| Green - waste | 32.25 |
| Timber(wood) | 6.99 |
| Consumable plastic | 5.86 |
| Industrial plastic | 1.18 |
| Steel & Materials | 0.03 |
| Rags & Textiles | 3.14 |
| Paper | 6.45 |
| Rubber & Leather | 1.45 |
| Inert | 34.65 |
| **Chemical Analysis** |
| Moisture content | 27.60 |
| pH value | 7.86 |
| Organic content | 39.06 |
| Carbon content | 21.53 |
| Nitrogen content | 0.73 |
| Phosphorous P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> | 0.63 |
| Potassium K<sub>2</sub>O | 0.63 |
| **Waste Generation by category** |
| Residential | 68 |
| Commercial | 16 |
| Halls, Schools, Institutions | 14 |
| Industrial | 2 |
| Hospitals & Clinics | Seperately disposed by hospitals |

The above table gives us a lucid idea that the Chennai garbage mainly consists of food waste and the green waste. Fortunately, the food waste and green waste are bio-degradable in nature, which means this waste can be recycled or composted. Such bio-degradable waste can be termed as organic solid waste. 

# 4.	Solution - Conversion of Organic Solid Waste into Bio - CNG
The approach of conversion of organic solid waste into a clean and useful energy can potentially solve the hazards created by the waste if left untreated. Also, since the organic waste constitutes more than 50% of the total garbage generation, this solution will go a long way in achieving the recycling process. Roughly half of the treated waste is organic which is convertible to bio-CNG through a process called “Biomethanation”. 

## 4.1 Biomethanation
Biomethanation is a process by which organic material is microbiologically converted under anaerobic conditions to biogas. It is a process of anaerobic digestion (AD) which implicates the decomposition of organic matter with the help of micro-organisms in oxygen free surroundings. Two major by-products could be achieved, one is bio-CNG (bio Compressed Natural Gas) and the digested organic sludge with high nutrient contain, used as a fertilizer. 
In contrast to CNG, which is formed by compressing a fossil fuel (natural gas), bio-CNG can be produced and scaled through renewable pathways. The organic waste biomass undergoes anaerobic digestion where bacteria break it down into simpler compounds. Biomethanation plants execute these steps under controlled conditions to generate biogas and organic manure. 
The biogas is filtered and compressed to yield bio-CNG, which can be used in the existing CNG-based vehicles after meeting the minimum threshold for purity. An estimate suggests that over 1.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of automotive-grade Bio-CNG can be generated by treating MSW alone in India (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy [MNRE], 2021).
![Organic solid waste to Bio -CNG production](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119152666/205116542-42fa6a09-0d40-4599-81bb-23b6a6b1970b.png)
Bio-CNG or bio-compressed natural gas, also known as sustainable natural gas or biomethane, is a biogas which has been upgraded to a quality similar to fossil natural gas and having a methane concentration of 90% or greater. As the gas is derived from natural and renewable sources, it is also termed renewable natural gas (RNG).

# 5. Applications of Proposed Solution

## 5.1 Bio – CNG plant in Indore, India.
India’s newest bio – CNG plant is installed in Indore, touted to be Asia’s largest. This plant is expected to process 550 tonnes of organic solid municipal waste per day to produce 17,000 kg of bio – CNG and 100 tonnes of organic compost. Also, as many as 75 municipalities across India are slated to get such bio-CNG plants over the next two years.

### Highlights
1. This plant is the largest and the first plant in the country for Bio-CNG from organic waste in the entire Asian continent.
2. In this plant, 550 MT of wet waste (domestic organic waste) will be treated daily, which will generate 17 thousand 500 kg of Bio-CNG Gas and 100 tonnes of high-quality organic compost will be produced.
3. Out of the bio-CNG generated from this plant, 50 percent gas will be available to Municipal Corporation, Indore for the use of public transport buses, the remaining 50 percent gas can be sold to various industrial and commercial consumers.
4. Apart from CNG, 100 tonnes of organic manure will also be received daily from the Indore plant. With this, about 400 buses will be run every day in Indore city.
5. Bio CNG Plant is based on the PPP (Public Private Partnership) model. On the one hand, the Municipal Corporation, Indore is not having to bear any financial burden on the establishment of this plant, on the other hand, the agency setting up the plant, IEISL, New Delhi, is paid Rs 2.5 crore per annum as premium to the Municipal Corporation, Indore.
6. Apart from CNG, 100 tonnes of organic manure will also be received daily from the Indore plant. With this, about 400 buses will be run every day in Indore city.
7. Since the waste segregation of Indore city is of excellent quality, it has been decided to set up this plant in Indore. Before the decision to set up the plant, the said company got the wet waste tested by taking more than 200 samples in the last one year. Based on the test results, it was revealed that only 0.5 to 0.9 percent of the rejects are available in wet waste, which was found to be of high quality as compared to other European countries.

## 5.2 Bio – CNG plants in Chennai, India.
The Greater Chennai Corporation has installed Bio – CNG plants in Egmore, Chennai and at Mahindra World city. The local government is planning to install 6 more Bio – CNG plants in the near future. 

### Highlights of Bio-CNG plant in Egmore, Chennai:
1. The plant has the capacity to handle 100 metric tonnes of organic waste
2. The plant produces about 4000 kg’s of Bio-CNG and 10 metric tonnes of bio – manure everyday
3. Many local restaurants are engaged with the plant for Bio – CNG supplies

### Highlights of Bio-CNG plant in Mahindra World city, Chennai:

1. An all new Bio-CNG plant was set up at Mahindra World City, Chennai as a joint CSR initiative between Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) and Mahindra World City Developers Limited (MWCDL).
2. The Bio-CNG plant converts 100% of the eight tons of food and kitchen waste generated daily in the city into 1000m3 of raw biogas. This raw bio gas can be enriched to yield 400kg/day of purified CNG grade fuel which is equivalent to a 200kW power plant.
3. Four tons of organic fertilizer is produced each day. 
4. The green energy (Bio-CNG) is effectively used to replace CNG as an automotive fuel (for CNG buses and tractors) and LPG for cooking purposes, as well as to power street lights at Mahindra World City, Chennai.
5. The organic fertilizer is used by farmers to enhance soil fertility.
6. The power generated is used for buses for free shuttle service and tractors for cultivation.

# 6. Challenges Faced by Bio-CNG Plants
A glaring problem in the way of success of the bio – CNG plants in India is “Segregation of waste”. The waste has to be segregated as dry waste and wet waste at its source. This means, it is imperative for all the citizens to play an active role in segregating the waste at their premise. In 2017, the Greater Chennai Corporation made it mandatory for individuals to segregate waste at the source in accordance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 published by the erstwhile Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. Further, the Solid Waste Management Department has also issued by-laws to provide guidelines to segregate waste. Yet, nothing much has changed in waste disposal methods in Chennai and also in many parts of India.

### Waste Segregation
Waste segregation can be defined as the process of identifying, classifying, dividing and sorting of garbage and waste products in an effort to reduce, reuse and recycle materials. When we segregate waste, there is not only a reduction of waste that gets landfilled, it also reduces pollution levels by lowering the percentage of garbage exposed to air and water. According to the Solid waste management rules 2016, it is essential to practice segregation of waste into
1. Bio - degradable or Wet waste
2. Non bio - degradable (recyclable and combustible) or Dry waste
3. Sanitary waste and 
4. Hazardous waste 

The color codes that can be followed for segregation of waste is shown below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119152666/205213769-10d7c529-699e-4a59-8ea2-d40028a7bc40.png)

Only if the waste is segregated properly at the source, the organic waste can reach the Bio-CNG plants instead of being dumped into the landfill sites. The success of the bio – CNG plants is highly dependent on the waste segregation.

# 7. Initiatives for Waste Segregation at Source

Confronted with the problem of waste, all the respective city corporations in India are taking various measures to implement segregation of waste at source. Below are few ideas/recommendations that can be used to make this possible.

1. The citizens to be educated to create an awareness on waste segregation. The problems faced in the landfill sites to be clearly showcased to the citizens to understand the current problems of solid waste management.
2. Effective campaign to be done throughout the country illustrating the importance of waste segregation. This campaign should mimic the election campaign done throughout the country.
3. Reward schemes can be introduced for communities which follow the rules of waste segregation at source.
4. Citizens can be penalized for improper disposal of waste.
5. Advertisements should be very efficient to register the color codes of different types of waste disposal. 
6. The City corporation can collaborate with the corporate companies to take the role of campaign among their employees and also in the neighborhood areas.
7. Tax benefits can be announced for the corporates and the non profit organizations who participates in the effective campaign.
8. The sanitary workers to be well educated about the effects of waste segregation.

# 8. Conclusion

Waste management is the need of the hour for India. It not only helps the country become greener and cleaner, but it also protects the ecology of the country. If waste segregation is efficiently done at source, the bio-CNG plants will effectively recycle all the organic waste. Since the organic waste accounts to more than 50% of the total generated garbage, the future success of the bio-CNG plants in India will make the country greener and healthier.
